## Description

We were instructed to recreate a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

Upon given a preexisting source code, we had to add and deduct preexisting code and create new code to help the app run properly in the browser. 

## Usage
When the user opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down, then they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. When the user views the time blocks for that day each time, a block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks into a time block I can enter an event. When the user clicks the save button for that time block then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When the user refreshes the page then the saved events persist.
